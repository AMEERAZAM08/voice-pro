## Install and run

### step 1. Package preparation
* A. Paid version
    + Unzip the compressed file (**voice-pro-x.zip**) included in the USB to an appropriate location on your computer.
    + Or, copy the already unzipped folder (**voice-pro-x**) to an appropriate location on your computer.

* B. Free version
  + [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/abus-aikorea/voice-pro)](https://github.com/abus-aikorea/voice-pro/ Download and unzip the latest release (**Source code (zip)**) from 
  + Or, download source code with git clone
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abus-aikorea/voice-pro.git
```

### step 2. Install and run the program
1. Run `configure.bat`
   - Install ffmpeg and CUDA (if using NVIDIA GPU) on Windows. 
   - You only need to run it the first time.
2. Run `start.bat`
   - Start Voice-Pro. Web-UI will run automatically. 
   - When running for the first time, Voice-Pro is installed first. 
   - Voice-Pro installation requires an Internet connection, and depending on the system, installation may take more than an hour. 
   - Never close the Windows-Command window during installation.
   - If a problem occurs during installation, delete the installer_files folder and run start.bat again.



### Run screen





### step 3. Uninstall program
* Run `uninstall.bat`:
  - Remove the installer_files folder.
  - Remove ffmepg and CUDA packages installed on Windows (if selected)

* Voice-Pro has **portable** installation as standard. To uninstall the program, deleting the installation folder is sufficient.


## Tips & Tricks

#### If Browser does not run automatically
- Close the Windows-Commnad window and run start.bat again.
- Run the browser directly and enter the address displayed in the Windows-Command window (e.g. **http://127.0.0.1:7892**) in the address bar.

#### If a CUDA Out-Of-Memory error occurs
- Check the GPU memory status in Windows Task Manager - Performance tab. 
- Set the Denoise level to 0 or 1. Denoise level 2 requires at least 8GB of GPU memory.
- Set Compute Type to int type. The float type has better quality, but requires more GPU memory.

#### How to improve the quality of subtitles?
- The quality of subtitles tends to improve with larger Whisper models, but this is not necessarily the case. large > medium > small > base > tiny 
- Among compute types, float type has good performance. The int type is a model that reduces GPU usage and increases speed through model quantization. On the other hand, performance decreases. 
- If you increase the denoise level, more background sounds will be removed, and only the remaining voice will be used for voice recognition. It does not always guarantee good results.
  

## caution
When Windows Defender mistakenly recognizes a batch file as a Trojan, this is often called a 'False Positive'. To solve this problem, you can go through the following steps:

1. File exception handling: In Windows Defender, you can set certain files or processes to skip security scanning. To do this, follow the steps below:
   * Click the ‚ÄòStart‚Äô button and go to ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòUpdate & Security‚Äô.
   * Select ‚ÄòWindows Security‚Äô and go to ‚ÄòVirus & threat protection‚Äô.
   * Click ‚ÄòManage Virus & Threat Protection Settings‚Äô.
   * Select 'Add exception' in 'Virus & threat protection settings'.
   * Select 'File or Folder', find the batch file in question and add it as an exception.
2. Temporarily disable Windows Defender: This may be a temporary solution. However, you must be careful when using this method as it may expose your computer to other threats.
3. Report the problem to anti-virus software: If you are sure that the file is not a Trojan horse, you can report it to Microsoft as a False Positive. Microsoft will review this and take any necessary action.
